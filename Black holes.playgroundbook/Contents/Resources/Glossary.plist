			<string>A star such as our sun maintains its size against its own gravity by the internal pressure generated by [nuclear fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermonuclear_fusion) of mostly hydrogen to helium. This process comes to an end when the abundance of light elements is diminished. With nothing counteracting the star&apos;s gravity, it collapses to extreme densities. Lighter stars will eventually be saved by [quantum mechanical pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerate_matter) to form a [white dwarf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf), as our sun will, or a more exotic [neutron star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star). Heavier stars that exceed around 20 solar masses overwhelm even this effect and will inevitably collapse to a black hole.
 
 By accreting gas, stars and radiation or by mergers with other black holes or neutron stars, black holes may grow in mass. In fact, observations suggest that each galaxy, such as our Milky Way, has a supermassive black hole in its center that can far exceed a million solar masses.</string>

		<dict>
			<key>Definition</key>
			<string>Any massive object has a Schwarzschild radius, but their internal structure usually extends far beyond its reach. This is the case also for the earth that has a Schwarzschild radius of only about 9mm but a radius of over 6000km.

 The matter that make up a black hole has collapsed to an area within its Schwarzschild radius, so any measurement device falling into it is unable to transmit information to the outside.  We will therefore never be able to observe the inside of a black hole. Since we do not know of any mechanism that would stop the gravitational collapse of the black hole&apos;s interior, we assume that all of its mass is located at a _singularity_ of infinite density at the center. This is clearly unphysical, so physicists are searching for a theory consolidating general relativity and quantum mechanics that may solve this issue.
