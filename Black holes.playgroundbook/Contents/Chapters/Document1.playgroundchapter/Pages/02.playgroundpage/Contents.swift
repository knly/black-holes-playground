 ## 2  Gravitational lensing
 
 Since not only massive particles but also light moves on geodesics through curved spacetime, it too is affected by the gravitational pull of a black hole or any other massive object. In fact, Einstein's prediction of the gravitational deflection of light by our sun was [confirmed in 1919](http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/220/571-581/291), four years after he published his theory of general relativity, by Eddington and his team during a solar eclipse. This discovery, with a British research team confirming a German physicist's theory shortly after World War I, was remarkable on its own and provided a crucial precision test of general relativity.
 
 Today, gravitational lensing is widely used by astronomers to study distant objects. The way a massive cluster of galaxies lenses a background light source can often tell us about the cluster's structure. Since visible matter cannot account for a large amount of the gravitational lensing we observe, astronomers conclude that the remaining mass may be of some unknown type that only interacts gravitationally and is therefore called [_dark matter_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter).
 
 - callout(Explore): In this simulation you can explore a variety of optical effects that occur when a massive object lenses a background light source. Move the device around or pan with your finger while keeping track of a background star that approaches the lens. In particular, you can try to find the following configurations that astronomers also observe with telescopes:
 
    - **Multiple images**: The light from a single background star reaches the observer on multiple paths.

    - **Einstein ring**: If a background star is placed precisely behind a spherically symmetric source, its multiple images combine to a closed ring. Since the lens [RXJ1131-1231](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/castles/Individual/RXJ1131.html) used in this simulation is slightly asymmetric, we see ring segments.

    You can select your own image as the lensed background source below.
