 ## Gravitational lensing
 
 Since not only massive particles but also light moves on geodesics through curved spacetime, it too is affected by the gravitational pull of a black hole or any other massive object. In fact, Einstein's prediction of the gravitational deflection of light by our sun was [confirmed in 1919](http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/220/571-581/291), four years after he published his theory of general relativity, by Eddington and his team during a solar eclipse. This discovery, with a British research team confirming a German physicist's theory shortly after World War I, was remarkable on its own and provided a crucial precision test of general relativity.
 
 Today, gravitational lensing is widely used by astronomers to study distant objects. The way a massive cluster of galaxies lenses a background light source can often tell us about the cluster's structure. Since visible matter cannot account for a large amount of the gravitational lensing we observe, astronomers conclude that the remaining mass may be of some unknown type that only interacts gravitationally and is therefore called [_dark matter_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter).

 In this simulation you can explore a variety of optical effects that occur when a massive object lenses a background light source. Move the device around or pan with your finger while keeping track of a background star that approaches the lens. In particular, you can try to find the following configurations that astronomers also observe with telescopes:
 
 - **Multiple images**:
 - **Einstein ring**:
