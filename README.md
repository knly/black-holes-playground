# Black holes in general relativity

In this [Swift playground book](http://www.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/) youâ€™ll explore the physics of [black holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole) in Albert Einstein's [theory of general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity) with three interactive simulations on your iPad.

- **Schwarzschild trajectories:** Explore the possible trajectories of test particles around a spherically symmetric source.

- **Light deflection:** Discover optical effects that occur when a massive object lenses a background light source.

- **Gravitational waves:** Watch two black holes merge and hear the gravitational waves they produce in the process.
